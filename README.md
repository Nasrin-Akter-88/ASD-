# ASD-
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological condition associated with
communication, repetitive and social challenges. ASD screening is the process of
detecting potential autistic traits in individuals using tests conducted by the medical
professionals, caregivers or parents. These tests often contain large numbers of
items to be covered by the user and they generate score based on scoring
functions designed by psychologists and behavioral scientists. Potential
technologies that may improve the reliability and accuracy of ASD tests are
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. . The goal of this paper is to research
and develop a prediction model to detect autism among toddlers. This paper
presents a Classifier to detect ASD applying Deep Neural Network. The neural
network applied is of four layers with three ReLU hidden layers and a sigmoid
classification layer. The best accuracy of 92.73% obtained on the cross validation
set upon trained parameters. Additionally, perfect recall 97.99%, precision of
99.32% and F Score of 98.65% has been achieved. Since machine learning is the
future for the next generationâ€™s problem solicitor to detect and decide key
decisions, hope this work contributes significantly in Autism Spectrum Disorder
detection.
